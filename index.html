<p>Dr. Oz: welcome all viewers and readers to today's interview! Today we are going to discuss such an important topic as treatment of type 2 diabetes, why you should stop taking metformin-based medications and what you should replace them with <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none; color: orangered;"><strong>Zempoza Blood Sugar Support</strong></a></p>
<p>I invited well-known American endocrinologist and diabetologist Dr. David M. Nathan. He is Director of the Diabetes Center and Center for Clinical Research at Massachusetts General Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Nathan has participated in numerous clinical trials and published numerous papers on the treatment of diabetes. He was personally involved in the development of a new drug at the Harvard University together with experts from Johnson &amp; Johnson</p>

<h2>Part 1: metformin and its problem</h2>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/1.png"></a>

<p><b>Hello, David! The Federal Department of Health and Human Services recommends that all type 2 diabetics stop taking metformin-based medications in favor of a new, all-natural drug. Let's start with what metformin is and what medications it is in. Tell us about it, please.</b></p>
<p>Hello Mehmet, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">Metformin is a chemical compound whose main purpose is to lower blood sugar levels by blocking glucose production (gluconeogenesis) in the liver and stimulating insulin production by the pancreas.</font> It has been used in almost all medications prescribed to type 2 diabetes patients for many years. Among the most popular such drugs at the moment are: </p>
<ul class="ListBlock-root ListBlock-ul">
<li>Glucophage</li>
<li>Glucophage XR</li>
<li>Glumetza</li>
<li>Riomet</li>
<li>Fortamet</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>So almost every diabetic takes metformin in one form or another. But if metformin has been used for many years, why have they decided not to use it now? Or is it really not working?</b></p>
<p>Not really. Metformin has long been used because it does lower sugar levels, but there's one big problem: Diabetes is a disease that progresses over time. This means that <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">over time, the body's resistance to insulin increases and it starts to be less absorbed.</font> What is the usual thing to do in such a case? Right: Stimulate insulin production more, which means taking more metformin. At some point this reaches a critical point and the patient gets an overabundance of insulin in the blood. To give you an idea of how dangerous this is, I want to remind you that insulin is similar in composition to gastric juice. What would happen if the gastric juice got into all of your organs? That's right: it would burn them out! Hence, we have a huge number of deadly side effects:</p>
<p>The blood begins to clot like sour milk, which leads to vascular thrombosis. Because the thick blood cannot flow normally, the blood vessels become clogged with cholesterol, resulting in high blood pressure. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">Hypertension occurs in 98% of diabetics.</font> In addition, there are many other problems with the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>Increased levels of insulin, which destroys our cells, contributes to their abnormal division, and causes cancer. That's why, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">statistically, 28% of diabetics have cancer.</font></p>
<p><b>The list of the most dangerous effects of metformin treatment includes:</b> </p>
<ul class="ListBlock-root ListBlock-ul">
<li><u>Gastrointestinal disorders</u> (mostly diarrhea, heartburn, belching, stomach ulcers).</li>
<li><u>High blood pressure:</u> hypertension, headaches (especially at night), tinnitus, anxiety.</li>
<li><u>Liver cirrhosis:</u> the liver is replaced by connective tissue and no longer cleanses the blood, so toxins fill the body.</li>
<li><u>Kidney stones</u> due to intense excretion of salt and sugar</li>
<li><u>Oncological diseases</u></li>
<li><u>Blindness</u></li>
<li><u>Premature death</u> due to organ dysfunction</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The development of side effects depends, of course, on the duration of the disease, the number of drugs taken, as well as on the individual characteristics of the body. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">But it is absolutely impossible to get rid of them!</font></p>
<h2>Part 2: Is metformin treatment even necessary?</h2>
<p><b>I'm just shocked by what I've heard! But if metformin kills the body, why is it still being used?</b></p>
<p>You see, metformin is the best thing that has been invented to treat diabetes until recently. In fact, of course, it's hard to call it a cure-you're also killing your body. Even more deplorable consequences arise from the fact that <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">doctors, for the most part, are not concerned about the consequences of this treatment for patients</font> - they do not consider it necessary to mention the risks of taking large amounts of metformin. Doctors just do their job - they prescribe drugs and get paid for it.</p>
<p>I am often approached by patients who have been taking methmorphine for years. These are sick people who are aging too early.</p>
<p>This is normal. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in patients is mostly diagnosed by chance during regular medical checkups. At this time, the patient usually has no problems and does not even suspect that he or she may have high blood sugar, and then is prescribed high doses of metformin.</p>
<p>Sugar levels decrease, but over time the patient's condition worsens. He begins to complain of chronic fatigue, obesity, high blood pressure, headaches, swollen feet and face. He hears ringing in his ears, feels tingling in his fingers and cold in his extremities. His vision and memory deteriorate.</p>
<p>Doctors think it's diabetes, but <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">it's all because of insulin!</font> More specifically, metformin, which increases the production of this hormone to abnormal levels!</p>
<p><b>Then I have a logical question for you: wouldn't it be better to refuse diabetes treatment altogether than to kill yourself with metformin?</b></p>
<p>Of course not! If you are hesitating between using metformin to treat or not treating your diabetes, you should definitely choose the first option. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">If left untreated, type 2 diabetes will kill you faster, but with different symptoms.</font></p>

</figure>
<p>Imagine a cherry or raspberry in caramel. The same thing happens to all the blood vessels in diabetes. The walls of the blood vessels fill with sugar and harden. As a result, blood vessels lose their ability to contract and expand. Small blood vessels are damaged first, followed by medium and large ones. Blood vessels carry nutrients to internal organs, and <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">poor blood supply leads to chronic disease.</font></p>
<p><b>How diabetes is destroying you from the inside:</b> </p>
<ul class="ListBlock-root ListBlock-ul">
<li><u>Loss of vision:</u> <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">It is not possible to fully restore vision with diabetes even with laser surgery</font>, since the retina is detached due to multiple hemorrhages.</li>
<li><u>Kidney failure:</u> Sugar clogs the urinary tract, completely disrupting kidney function. Chronic kidney failure is just the tip of the iceberg. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">The kidneys can stop functioning completely.</font></li>
<li><u>Loss of joint mobility:</u> Synovial fluid ensures joint mobility. When the blood vessels stop supplying the joint, synovial fluid is no longer produced. The joint ceases to function normally. The patient feels unbearable pain. Even painkillers don't help. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">The patient loses the ability to move independently.</font></li>
<li><u>Nervous System Disorders:</u> Nerve fibers, like many other organs, are damaged by excess sugar. Over time, diabetics become emotionally unstable. They often fall into severe depression and see no way out of it. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">Nothing can make them feel good about themselves.</font></li>
<li><u>Skin damage:</u> dry skin is typical, followed by rashes, cracks, eczema and ulcers. An unpleasant odor appears. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">Everything ends in gangrene.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 3: developing a new drug</h2>
<p><b>Okay, then what about the new product? Is it safer than metformin? Tell me about it.</b></p>
<p>To begin with, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">the reason for developing the product was the large number of patients in severe conditions with side effects, and the resulting high mortality rate from taking metformin.</font></p>
<p>I want to point out once again that type 2 diabetes is a complex, dangerous, complex disease. It's not a cold or diarrhea. It is a disease that spreads throughout the body, so the treatment must be complex. Simply increasing insulin levels is unhealthy and not enough.</p>
<center>
<div style="padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; background-color: #ff6666; border-radius: 10px">
<font style="color: white"><b>The treatment of diabetes requires a comprehensive approach and should be carried out using those products that not only reduce blood sugar levels, but also provide safety for the whole body.</b></font>
</div>
</center>
<br>
<p>At the Harvard University, we started developing a new drug five years ago. The main task was to create a product that would <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">consist entirely of natural ingredients, so that patients would not have side effects</font> like they would from taking metformin. The next, but equally important, task was to make sure that the new product actually restored the pancreas, rather than forcing it to artificially produce more insulin.</p>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/e0nnk2rhgv3e2ibr4tvorj2txdv4gt5z.jpg"></a>
</figure>
<p>It took us four years to develop it and luckily it was a success. It took another year to test the product and only now we are ready to present it to you:</p>
<center>
<div style="padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; background-color: #ff6666; border-radius: 10px">
<font style="color: white"><b> contains vitamins as well as macro- and micronutrients necessary for type 2 diabetes. This capsule contains plant extracts collected from various parts of the world.</b></font>
</div>

<br>
<p> is excellent because <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">it does not harm the body.</font> In addition, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">it strengthens the body</font> of diabetics. Most importantly, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">it is effective for type 2 diabetes.</font></p>

<h2>Part 4: drug test results</h2>
<p><b>Sounds great! But what did the statistics for testing this drug show?</b></p>
<p>If the drug testing had been bad, I wouldn't be telling you about it right now. So, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">of the 5,000 patients</font> we switched from metformin to , <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">4,578 had their blood sugar levels down to normal</font> after 2 months of taking the drug. And, also importantly, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">no one had any side effects.</font> This means that patients can lead normal lives with minimal restrictions.</p>
<p>I want to show you a letter from a patient of ours. Her name is Emilia Prado, 67 years old. She was one of the first to try instead of metformin. This is what she wrote after six months of taking the drug:</p>

<p>Hello, dear Dr. David! You asked me to describe my medical history and changes after taking , now I am happy to do so!</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of 55 (I am now 67) after a routine medical checkup. I was very frightened at the time, but the doctors said it was normal and many people live with this diagnosis. They gave me a diet plan to follow, recommendations on physical exercises that I had to do all the time. The glucose meter became my constant companion in life. I started seeing an endocrinologist on a regular basis. And, of course, I was prescribed medications: glucophage and vocanamet.</p>
<p>At first it was fine. Yes, I often wanted to eat something delicious and was too lazy to exercise, but I got used to this life. For a while I even stopped worrying about being sick.</p>
<p>However, a few years later, my sugar levels were again higher than normal, even though I was following the diet and also exercising constantly. Then the doses of glucophage and vocanamet were gradually increased. For a while, everything was normal again.</p>
<p>By the time I was 62, my health began to deteriorate again, but this time it was not just my sugar levels that were the problem: I had frequent abdominal pain, my blood pressure began to rise, and my eyesight noticeably deteriorated. I was diagnosed with hypertension and discovered that I had kidney stones. This made me very upset. The doctors said it was due to a combination of type 2 diabetes and age-related changes, and they continued to increase my medication dosage.</p>
<p>Year after year, it only got worse. I could no longer do physical exercises, and spent most of my time lying in bed in pain. My diabetes got much worse: I smelled like acetone all the time. Even my own daughter could not sit next to me. I had sores on my feet and my fingertips went dark. The doctors said I didn't have much time left and there was nothing to be done about it. I started crying a lot: I didn't want to die, I had a beautiful life and a beautiful family.</p>
<p>Because of the constant pain, I couldn't sleep properly and often watched TV. And, one day, I saw your speech, Dr. David. You were talking about the development of a new drug for diabetes. At the time, the drug had not yet been tested, and it was offered for free: all you had to do was call and place an order.</p>
<p>A few days later the courier brought me , I signed papers to join the group of patients testing the drug and started taking it according to the instructions. I was also told to report regularly on my condition.</p>
<p>In fact, I didn't really believe that it would help. I just had nothing else to do, so I decided to try it, especially since it was free.</p>
<p>But after a week of taking it, what happened for me was a real miracle: I began to feel a significant improvement in my well-being. The sores on my feet gradually went away, the blackness on my toes, too. After another week, my blood pressure and sugar levels began to go down. Each week I felt better and better.</p>
<p>As I write this letter, it has been 6 months since I started . I am happy to say that I feel like a healthy person again! The condition that I had been in for the last few years now seems like just a bad dream. I am sleeping well again, my constant thirst is gone, I no longer have to pee so much, I am not tired and weak anymore, my eyesight is better, my blood pressure and sugar levels are always normal now! Most importantly, I can spend time with my family again and my daughter no longer sees me lying in bed on the verge of death.</p>
<p>I am madly grateful to you, Dr. David. If it wasn't for you, I probably wouldn't be alive anymore. Now I know that my terrible condition was not only caused by diabetes, but also by metformin, which I was taking in high doses because that is how I was treated by other doctors. I really hope that soon the world will do away with metformin and that people with diabetes will live much longer.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Dr. David! For me, you are a real magician. I am sure that your medicine will cure millions of people and make this world a better place.</p>
<p>Love, Emilia.</p>

<h2>Part 5: How the drug works</h2>
<p><b>That's amazing! So, your drug really works and saves lives! Now I would like to ask a question: how long does the treatment last and how does it go?</b></p>
<p><font style="background-color: #ffdb99">On average, the treatment cycle takes about 2 months.</font> But, in cases where the patient is in a very serious condition, as was the case with Emilia Prado, the treatment can take much longer. In her example, it was 6 months. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">You have to be prepared for a long treatment,</font> but once it's over, you'll be free of the symptoms that are bothering you and can lead a full healthy life. I would also like to point out that helps everyone regardless of age, including people with a lowered immune system.</p>
<p><b>Now I will tell you about the stages of treatment:</b> </p>
<ul class="ListBlock-root ListBlock-ul">
<li><u>Vascular Restoration:</u> The main effect of is that <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">it normalizes the level of glucose.</font> It dissolves sugar, which penetrates through the walls of blood vessels thanks to the juniper extract present in its composition. The walls of blood vessels, freed from deposits, again become elastic. The active ingredients of these capsules dissolve clots and clean the vessels, restoring small capillaries and normalizing blood flow. That is why patients get rid of high blood pressure. Fatigue and drowsiness disappear, wounds and cuts heal faster. The body is filled with vivacity and energy, and the strength for normal life appears.</li>
<li><u>Reduced insulin resistance:</u> <font style="background-color: #ffdb99"> does not increase insulin levels</font> and therefore it is safe, which is a very good property. The biologically active components of this product penetrate directly into muscle, fatty tissues and liver cells and stimulate them to respond better to the presence of hormones in the blood. In medicine, this process is called "secondary cell formation." As a consequence, the cells eventually begin to consume active glucose, which leads to a decrease in its concentration in the blood. This is the safest way for the body to use glucose. Patients begin to feel good at any time of the day, even after a meal. They do not feel very thirsty, they no longer have skin disorders such as eczema, rashes, unpleasant odor disappears. The urinary regime is normalized: <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">there is a decrease in the level of glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as a decrease in the concentration of sugar and acetone in the urine.</font></li>
<li><u>Weight loss:</u> With a 10% weight loss, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">the risk of dangerous effects of diabetes is reduced by almost 50%.</font></li>
<li><u>Energy Balance:</u> Many diabetics lack energy. One of the effects of capsules is the <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">normalization of testosterone levels and restoration of sexual potency.</font> Men can have sexual intercourse even at the age of 50-60.</li>
<li><u>Improvement of the skin, bones and muscles:</u> Even badly damaged skin is regenerated. Ulcers heal. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">All tissues regenerate and muscles regain their elasticity.</font></li>
<li><u>Restoration of vision:</u> Even severely impaired <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">vision gradually begins to recover.</font> What you used to see through the fog becomes clear. You can see the bus number from afar and enjoy the beauty of nature again.</li>
<li><u>Improved concentration:</u> You are completely <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">calm and relaxed.</font> You no longer have the constant headache that impairs self-control and prevents you from concentrating on anything else. When one is free of pain, one begins to feel more acutely the sounds, smells, and tastes of life.</li>
<li><u>Restore mobility:</u> When you leave the house, you no longer have to worry about your feet: walking is not an unpleasant activity for you: <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">your feet do not get tired or swollen.</font> Barefoot shoes, shoes and socks do not leave marks on swollen feet.</li>
<li><u>Easy awakening:</u> In the morning you wake up easily and have no difficulty getting out of bed. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">Your body is full of energy and strength in the morning.</font></li>
<li><u>Improvement of general condition and mood:</u> <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">Normalization of sleep and wakefulness.</font> Sleep becomes calm and sound. You feel rejuvenated.</li>
<li><u>Butterfly Effect:</u> The effect is similar to the butterfly effect, which causes a chain reaction of internal organ healing and improvement of overall well-being, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">starting with normalization of vascular activity and ending with recovery of vision and joints.</font></li>
<li><u>No dieting:</u> You can fill your menu with a variety of foods, as you no longer have to follow a strict diet. <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">You can eat what you've always wanted</font> - enjoy the taste of your favorite foods!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>And, most importantly, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99"> prolongs life!</font> You will feel healthy and awake even at an advanced age. Your loved ones won't have to take care of you, because you can take care of yourself.</p>
<h2>Part 6: Where can I get the drug now?</h2>
<p><b>Thank you for the detailed explanation, Dr. David! I think we have discussed everything about how the drug works. The last question I'd like to ask you is: where can I buy now, and are there any promotions on it?</b></p>
<p>At the moment we are not yet producing the product in such quantities to sell it in all pharmacies, so the easiest way to buy is to <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">order it from our official website.</font> I think you could attach a link to the site below our interview, so that people don't have to look for it themselves and come across a fake one.</p>
<figure class="Figure" style="text-align: center;  margin-top: -10px;">
<a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"><img src="./index_files/530289.webp"></a>
</figure>
<p>And yes, <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">because we are supported by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services,</font> Then, if you like it, you can buy it at a permanent discount on our website as well. I think that when appears in the drugstores, the prices will still be higher and, of course, you will not be able to try the product for free. That is why I advise you to order it only from our website.</p>
<p><b>Great! We'll attach a link to your website below our interview. Thank you for providing comprehensive information about the product. Would you like to leave a last wish for our viewers and readers?</b></p>
<p>Of course! I want to appeal to all people with diabetes who are reading this: <font style="background-color: #ffdb99">you can be the healthy and happy people</font> you've always dreamed of being. If diabetes used to be a death sentence, now science makes it possible to overturn this sentence, and we have proven it! Now the decision is yours: switch to a modern remedy and feel life as it really is, or keep taking metformin until the same thing that happened to Emilia Prado happens to you. I sincerely wish everyone wellness and excellent health!</p>

Thank you for your kindness! I wanted to buy at another clinic, but they told me it cost 10 times this amount, so in the end I didn't buy it. An acquaintance gave me the link to this article, I ordered it and it arrived very quickly, I have started the treatment and I can already see the results!

I confirm everything the doctor said! Metmorphine is bad because it poisons people and wastes people´s mpney! I used it for seven years and got no results. My sugar levels kept going up and up and up. I didn't know what to do, but then I found and the difference was huge. This natural capsule has really improved my condition unlike all those dangerous chemicals. Friends, I recommend to everyone.

I was predisposed to diabetes, high blood sugar levels. I felt like an old woman: I could not walk or stand for a long time, I was constantly thirsty, my face and legs were swollen. I weighed 120 kg in one year - considering I'm tall, I was a mess! I was even out of breath and sweating a lot going up to the second floor. A month ago, I finished the course of treatment with and I am slowly starting to recover. It is much easier to walk, my legs are less swollen and in 2 months I lost 12 kg. My blood sugar is normal. I am slowly recovering.

Diabetes is a terribly insidious disease. I have had it for 4 years. The truth is that I only had one symptom, and that is that my throat would get dry. So I don't really believe in leg amputations and things like that, but I did faint once, that's why. They took me to the hospital and did some tests. The results were horrible. The kidneys were in a pre-cancerous state, the blood vessels were destroyed and the doctors were freaking out.

Of course it will help him! He should try it in any case, plus is cheaper than metformin.

is a good product. Our daughter has diabetes and she is only 7 years old. We didn't want to give her chemicals because she is too young. We talked to many endocrinologists and decided to choose . It has really helped her. Her sugar levels have almost stopped going up.
